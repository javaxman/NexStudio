## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## Cloudflare deploy notes

If you deploy with Wrangler in CI/Cloudflare, build first and deploy using Astro's generated Worker config:

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Deploy command: `npm run deploy:cf`

This avoids entrypoint errors like `@astrojs/cloudflare/entrypoints/server` not found.

## Contact form configuration

Set these variables for the website contact form.

Public (frontend):

- `PUBLIC_CONTACT_FORM_ACTION_URL` (default `/api/contact`)
- `PUBLIC_CONTACT_FORM_SUCCESS_REDIRECT` (absolute URL for `_next`)
- `PUBLIC_CONTACT_FORM_MAILTO` (fallback only if `ACTION_URL` is empty)
- `PUBLIC_CONTACT_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`

Server-side (Cloudflare runtime / local `.env`):

- `CONTACT_FORM_MODE` (`dev` or `live`)
- `CONTACT_FORM_RESEND_API_KEY`
- `CONTACT_FORM_FROM_EMAIL` (verified sender in Resend)
- `CONTACT_FORM_TO_EMAIL` (recipient inbox or alias)
- `CONTACT_TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`

Mode behavior:

- `dev`: accepts form and logs payload server-side (no real email send)
- `live`: verifies Turnstile (if secret configured) and sends via Resend API

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local development and configure the same keys in Cloudflare Pages/Workers for production.
